# Aardwolf-Mushclient-Scripts
Mostly hacks of other scripts I have made to adapt to my needs. Tested on AardMush v2040

Contents:
Report_id_lbid - this script helps parsing an item into the chat window with 0 effort
my change - introduced the feature to parse from LBID (already possible via lore, c id and id)
